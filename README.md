# BadApp
This is an Android Project used for managing appointments between Patients, Nurses, and Doctors. The application allows their main users (Patients) to register accounts and login using emails, as well as book
appointments with their selected doctors. Doctors and Nurses can also use this application to view upcoming appointments and 
record data about past appointments.

This application is a group work in the Final Project of the course CS207 - Object Oriented Software Design, at Fulbright University Vietnam, Fall 2023 Semester
